# Configuration files for Awesome Window Manager

Credit for the base of this config goes to [Sam1431](https://github.com/Sam1431) at their repository [NixSome](https://github.com/Sam1431/NixSome). I have made quite a few changes to the organization, color schemes, and functionality, but the base framework came from them.

Credit for widgets in the widget/awesome-wm-widgets-master directory goes to [Pavel Makhov](https://pavelmakhov.com/awesome-wm-widgets/)
